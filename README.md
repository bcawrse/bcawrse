### Hello ðŸ‘‹

:computer: I'm a programmer by trade, always looking for that next challenge with a passion for maintainable software that's also pleasant to work with. 

My background is mostly Web on .Net with a good mix of open source tech. I'm generally in Windows with a heavy reliance on [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) for those linux tools. A jack of all trades and picking up more.
